== NAME

rigctld-atdx - Hamlib 3 rigctld server.

== SYNOPSIS

*rigctld-atdx* [OPTIONS]

== DESCRIPTION

*atdx* uses a version of the *hamlib* CAT control library.  This
 library is heavily modified over the current release version of
 *hamlib*. If a *atdx* user wishes to use the *hamlib* network rig
 server *rigctld* to remotely control their transceiver; then this
 special version of *rigctld* should be used since that too has the
 modified *hamlib* code embedded with it.
